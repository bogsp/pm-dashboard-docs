# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions and answers about PM Dashboard installation, usage, and troubleshooting.

## General

### What is PM Dashboard?

PM Dashboard is a minimalist project management tool designed for small teams and individuals. It provides a visual Kanban board, progress tracking, team activity feeds, and file management in a clean, focused interface.

### Who is PM Dashboard for?

PM Dashboard is ideal for:
- Small teams (2-10 people)

## Installation & Setup

### What are the system requirements?

**Minimum requirements:**
- Node.js 18.17 or later
- npm, yarn, or pnpm package manager
- Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

**Recommended:**
- Node.js 20+ for best performance
- pnpm for faster installs
- TypeScript for type safety

### How do I install PM Dashboard?
```bash
npm install pm-dashboard
# or
yarn add pm-dashboard
# or
pnpm add pm-dashboard
```

See [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) for detailed setup instructions.

### Can I use PM Dashboard with create-react-app?

Yes! PM Dashboard works with any React application:
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm install pm-dashboard
```

Then import and use components as documented.

### Does PM Dashboard work with Next.js?

Yes, PM Dashboard is built with Next.js in mind and works seamlessly with both Pages Router and App Router.

### Can I use PM Dashboard with TypeScript?

Absolutely! PM Dashboard is written in TypeScript and provides full type definitions out of the box.

### Do I need a backend?

PM Dashboard is a frontend component library. You'll need to:
- Provide your own data (tasks, users, files)
- Handle API calls to your backend
- Manage authentication and authorization
- Store data in your database

PM Dashboard handles the UI; you handle the data.

## Features & Functionality

### What features does PM Dashboard include?

**Core features:**
- Kanban board with drag-and-drop
- Progress visualization charts
- Real-time activity feed
- File attachments
- Task comments
- User assignments
- Due dates and priorities
- Custom columns and workflows

### Can I customize the columns?

Yes! Columns are fully customizable:
- Add/remove columns dynamically
- Rename columns
- Reorder columns
- Set work-in-progress (WIP) limits
- Custom colors per column
```tsx
const columns = [
  { id: 'backlog', title: 'Backlog', tasks: [] },
  { id: 'ready', title: 'Ready', tasks: [], limit: 5 },
  { id: 'in-progress', title: 'In Progress', tasks: [], limit: 3 },
  { id: 'review', title: 'Review', tasks: [] },
  { id: 'done', title: 'Done', tasks: [] },
]
```

### Does it support real-time updates?

PM Dashboard components support real-time updates when you connect them to a real-time data source:

- WebSocket connections
- Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Polling
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Supabase Realtime

You provide the data stream; PM Dashboard renders the updates.

### Can I add custom fields to tasks?

Yes! The `Task` type is extensible:
```tsx
interface CustomTask extends Task {
  estimatedHours?: number
  actualHours?: number
  tags?: string[]
  customField?: any
}

<TaskCard task={customTask} />
```

### Does it support file uploads?

PM Dashboard includes a `FilesList` component for displaying files. You need to:
- Handle the upload process
- Store files (S3, Firebase Storage, etc.)
- Provide file URLs to the component

See [Files documentation](/docs/components/files) for examples.

### Can I integrate with Slack/Discord/Email?

Yes! Use event handlers to trigger integrations:
```tsx
<KanbanBoard
  columns={columns}
  onTaskMove={(taskId, from, to) => {
    updateTask(taskId, to)
    sendSlackNotification(`Task moved to ${to}`)
  }}
/>
```

---

## Customization & Theming

### Can I customize the styling?

Yes! PM Dashboard uses Tailwind CSS and accepts custom `className` props on all components:
```tsx
<KanbanBoard
  columns={columns}
  className="rounded-xl shadow-2xl"
/>
```

You can also override default styles in your CSS.

### Does it support dark mode?

PM Dashboard components respect your Tailwind dark mode configuration:
```tsx
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class',
  // ...
}

// Usage
<div className="dark">
  <KanbanBoard columns={columns} />
</div>
```

### Can I change the colors?

Yes! Customize colors through:

1. **Tailwind configuration:**
```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#8b5cf6',
        // ...
      },
    },
  },
}
```

2. **Component props:**
```tsx
<ProgressChart
  data={[
    { label: 'Done', value: 12, color: '#8b5cf6' },
  ]}
/>
```

### Can I use custom icons?

Yes! Most components support custom rendering:
```tsx
import { Circle, CheckCircle } from 'lucide-react'

<TaskCard
  task={task}
  renderStatus={(status) => (
    status === 'done' 
      ? <CheckCircle className="text-green-500" />
      : <Circle className="text-gray-400" />
  )}
/>
```

## Data & Backend

### What database should I use?

PM Dashboard is database-agnostic. Popular choices:
- PostgreSQL (with Prisma or Drizzle)
- MongoDB
- Firebase Firestore
- Supabase
- MySQL

Choose based on your needs and expertise.

### How do I handle authentication?

PM Dashboard doesn't include auth. Use:
- NextAuth.js
- Clerk
- Auth0
- Supabase Auth
- Firebase Auth
- Custom solution

Then pass the authenticated user to components:
```tsx
const { user } = useAuth()

<TaskCard
  task={task}
  assignee={user}
/>
```

### Can I use it with GraphQL?

Yes! Fetch data with GraphQL and pass to components:
```tsx
const { data } = useQuery(GET_TASKS)

<KanbanBoard columns={formatColumns(data.tasks)} />
```

### Does it work with tRPC?

Absolutely! PM Dashboard works with any data fetching solution:
```tsx
const { data: tasks } = trpc.tasks.list.useQuery()

<KanbanBoard columns={groupTasks(tasks)} />
```

### How do I handle file storage?

Popular options:
- **AWS S3**: Scalable, reliable
- **Firebase Storage**: Easy setup
- **Cloudinary**: Image optimization
- **Vercel Blob**: Serverless storage
- **Supabase Storage**: Open source

PM Dashboard just needs the file URL:
```tsx
const file = await uploadToS3(selectedFile)

<FilesList files={[{
  id: file.id,
  name: file.name,
  url: file.url,
  // ...
}]} />
```

---

## Performance

### How do I optimize for large datasets?

**For 100+ tasks:**
- Implement pagination or infinite scroll
- Use React.memo on task cards
- Virtualize long lists with react-window
- Load columns lazily
- Debounce drag events

**Example with virtualization:**
```tsx
import { FixedSizeList } from 'react-window'

<FixedSizeList
  height={600}
  itemCount={tasks.length}
  itemSize={80}
>
  {({ index, style }) => (
    <TaskCard style={style} task={tasks[index]} />
  )}
</FixedSizeList>
```

### Why is drag-and-drop slow?

Common causes:
- Too many tasks rendering at once
- Missing React.memo on cards
- Heavy re-renders on drag
- Large images/files not lazy loaded

Solutions:
- Memoize components
- Virtualize lists
- Optimize images
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth dragging

### How can I reduce bundle size?

**Tree-shaking:**
Import only what you need:
```tsx
// Good
import { KanbanBoard } from 'pm-dashboard'

// Avoid
import * as PMDashboard from 'pm-dashboard'
```

**Code splitting:**
```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const KanbanBoard = dynamic(() => 
  import('pm-dashboard').then(mod => mod.KanbanBoard)
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Components not rendering

**Check:**
1. Installed PM Dashboard: `npm list pm-dashboard`
2. Correct import paths
3. Required props provided
4. No console errors
5. Tailwind CSS configured

### Drag-and-drop not working

**Verify:**
- Browser supports HTML5 drag-and-drop
- `draggable` prop is true
- Event handlers attached
- No CSS `pointer-events: none`
- Parent allows overflow

### Styles not applying

**Common issues:**
1. Tailwind not configured
2. Missing `import 'pm-dashboard/styles.css'`
3. CSS specificity conflicts
4. Purging Tailwind classes

**Fix:**
```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    './node_modules/pm-dashboard/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
}
```

### TypeScript errors

**Solutions:**
1. Update TypeScript: `npm install -D typescript@latest`
2. Install types: `npm install -D @types/react`
3. Check tsconfig.json settings
4. Restart TypeScript server

### Real-time updates not working

**Debug:**
1. WebSocket connection active
2. Event listeners attached
3. State updates triggering re-renders
4. No errors in console
5. Backend sending updates
